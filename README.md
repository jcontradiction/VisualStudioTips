Use HOME to go to the very left of a line, use END to go to the very right of a line. Add CTRL to go to the very top of the file and very bottom of the file respectively.<br>
Highlight text instead of using the mouse : Use SHIFT + ARROW KEY. Use this in conjunction with CTRL word by word navigation or Home and End navigation to select large amount of text.<br>

turn on line numbers for all files<br>
turn on white space characters<br>
use the mouse less, it takes a little bit but you'll get faster.<br>
